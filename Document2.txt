In this lab you will manually verify information related to GPT(GUID Partition Table) disk. GPT is a partitioning scheme that is part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface specification. It is the next generation partitioning scheme desiged to succeed the Master Boot Record paritioning scheme method. It evolved to deal with several shortcomings of the MBR and offers additional advantages.

Protective MBR is the same as a normal MBR but the 64-byte area contains a single 0xEE type Primary partition entry defined over the entire size of the disk. This structure is designed to enable older tools/OS's that cannot read GPT disks to recognize the disk as containing one parition of unknown type with no empty space. The system will then typically refuse to modify the disk unless the user explicitly requests the changes.

The majority of the information regarding the structure of the GPT disk is contained within the Partition Header.

The primary version of the Partition Header is found in Sector LBA 1 and the backup copy can be found in the last sector of the disk (Last LBA)

The partition table header defines the usable blocks on the disk. It also defines the number and size of the partition entries that make up the partition table.

The EFI stipulates a minimum of 16,384 bytes has to be reserved for the partition table array. This means that there are 128 partition entries reserved, each 128 bytes long.

The Sleuth Kit tools (Autopsy) are named in logical manner, which indicates the file system layer they operate upon and the type of output to be expected from them. The commands prefixes are as follow:

  mm*  : tools that operate on volumes (media management)
  fs*  : tools that operate on file system structures
  blk* : tools that operate at the data unit layer
  i*   : tools that operate at the metadata layer (inode)
  f*   : tools that operate at the file name layer
  
  The fls list files and directory information from an image, along with inode information. The icat command reads the contents of a file, and the istat command allows access to the file metadata.
  
  Most of the forensic tools are able to read and present metadata information regarding files and directories. In case of file system corruption or just data verification it is essential that you can manually verify metadata information stored in the file system.
